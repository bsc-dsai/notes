    <h1>Why Study Probability and Statistics?</h1>
    
    <p>Let's motivate this discussion with a simple example. Assume we have a basket of apples and bananas—say, 1,000 of them—and our task is to identify the type of fruit, whether it’s an apple or a banana, based on certain characteristics like shape, color, etc.</p>

    <p>For simplicity, we will focus on the <strong>color</strong> aspect. Most of us know that apples tend to be <strong>more</strong> red compared to bananas. To analyze this, we can carry out an empirical experiment by picking 1,000 apples and measuring their redness. Each measurement is an outcome, and the experiment can be repeated with each fruit.</p>

    <p>There’s uncertainty involved here because, a priori, we can't say exactly what the value of redness will be. After repeating this experiment on 1,000 bananas, we again get different outcomes with uncertainty.</p>

    <p>What probability and statistics allow us to do is to look for underlying patterns in these outcomes. While it’s likely that apples will have more redness compared to bananas, our goal is to quantify such terms like <strong>likely</strong>, <strong>probable</strong>, and <strong>less</strong> or <strong>more</strong> with mathematical formulations.</p>
    
    <p>Now that you have a sense of why studying probability and statistics is important, you can <a href="index.html">go back to the syllabus</a> to explore the topics we’ll cover in this course.</p>
