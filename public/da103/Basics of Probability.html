    <!--Introduction to Probability-->

    <div class="container" id="Introduction to Probability">
        <h1>Introduction to Probability</h1>
        <p>Probability theory deals with the study of random phenomena. Experiments are repeatable, and each time an
            experiment is performed, you will get different outcomes. These outcomes often exhibit underlying patterns.
        </p>
        <p>An <strong>event</strong> is a subset of outcomes from an experiment. A <strong>random experiment</strong> is
            one where the outcome cannot be predicted precisely. A single performance of the random experiment is called
            a <strong>trial</strong>.</p>
        <p>The classical definition of probability defines the probability of an event A as:</p>
        <p><strong>P(A) = (Number of outcomes favorable to A) / (Total number of possible outcomes)</strong></p>
        <p>This definition assumes that the outcomes are <strong>equally likely</strong>.</p>
        <div class="math">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <h3>Example 1: Selecting a Black or Red Ball</h3>
            <p>Consider a box containing 7 black balls and 3 red balls. The probability of selecting a black ball is:
            </p>
            <p><strong>P(Black) = 7/10</strong></p>
            <p>The probability of selecting a red ball is:</p>
            <p><strong>P(Red) = 3/10</strong></p>
            <p>These probabilities add up to 1, as per the axioms of probability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="math">
            <h3>Example 2: Rolling a Fair Die</h3>
            <p>Consider rolling a fair die. The die has six faces numbered 1 through 6. The probability of getting a 6
                is:</p>
            <p><strong>P(6) = 1/6</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--Relative Frequency Definition of Probability-->
    <div class="container" id="Relative Frequency Definition of Probability">
        <h1>Relative Frequency Definition of Probability</h1>
        <p>The next type of definition that I want to introduce to you is that of relative frequency with regards to the
            probability measure. It states that the probability of the event A is defined as:</p>
        <p><strong>P(A) = (Number of outcomes favorable to A) / (Total number of trials)</strong></p>
        <p>Here, N is the total number of trials. You have to perform the experiment N number of times, but N is going
            to be a very large number approaching infinity. With such a large number of trials, approaching infinity, we
            are interested in the number of possible outcomes that are favorable to event A.</p>
        <p>Based on that, you can define <strong>P(A)</strong>. One limitation in this definition is that you need to go
            for a large number of trials approaching infinity, which may not be feasible for many applications.</p>
        <p>Having introduced both the classical and relative frequency definitions of probability, we notice that they
            work under limited circumstances. Next, we will start focusing on the axioms of probability, which we will
            discuss in detail later.</p>
        <h2>Example: Probability of Divisibility by a Prime Number</h2>
        <p>To demonstrate the idea of the relative frequency definition of probability, consider the following example:
        </p>
        <p>The problem asks to determine the probability that a given number is divisible by a prime number.</p>
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>If you choose N integers, you know that the numbers that are divisible by a prime number, say p, will be
            given by n/p. Let's take p = 5 as an example. If you consider numbers from 1 to 201, you know that 5, 10,
            15, and so on up to 200 are divisible by 5.</p>
        <p>How many such numbers exist? You can calculate it as:</p>
        <p><strong>200/5 = 40</strong></p>
        <p>So, there are 40 numbers divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, ..., 200). This means there are
            <strong>n/p</strong>favorable outcomes for the event that a given number is divisible by a prime number.
        </p>
        <p>In this case, we took p = 5, but in general, for a prime number p, there will be n/p possibilities. For a
            large value of N, approaching infinity, the relative frequency definition can be applied:</p>
        <p><strong>P(A) = lim n -> &#8734 (n/p) / n = 1/p</strong></p>
        <p>In conclusion, the probability that a given number is divisible by a prime number p is <strong>1/p</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Introduction to sample space, events-->
    <div class="container" id="Introduction to sample space, events">
        <h1>Sample Space Definition</h1>
        <p>Having introduced the classical and relative frequency definitions of probability, we now move on to defining
            what is called a <strong>sample space</strong>. This concept is crucial for our study in this course.</p>
        <p>Consider an experiment where two coins are tossed simultaneously. The outcomes of this experiment can be
            represented as follows:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <h3>Possible outcomes are:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Head,
                <li>Head, Tail</li>
                <li>Tail, Head</li>
                <li>Tail, Tail</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case, there are four possible outcomes. These outcomes form a set, which is referred to as the
                <strong>sample space</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>If we select the outcomes Head, Head; Head, Tail; and Tail, Head, we have a subset of the sample space. This
            subset represents the event that at least one head has occurred:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <h4>Subset A: {Head, Head, Head, Tail, Tail, Head}</h4>
            <h4>This event describes scenarios where at least one head appears among the outcomes.</h4>
        </div>

        <p>To summarize, a <strong>sample space</strong> is the collection of all possible outcomes of a random
            experiment. Each individual outcome in the sample space is called a <strong>sample point</strong>. The
            sample space can be categorized as:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finite</li>
                <li><strong>Countably finite</li>
                <li><strong>Uncountable</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Additionally, the sample space can be further classified into:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discrete Sample Space</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Sample Space</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--Categorizing Sample Spaces-->
    <div class="container" id="Categorizing Sample Spaces">
        <h1>Categorizing Sample Spaces</h1>

        <p>Let us now continue our discussion on how to categorize the sample spaces.</p>

        <h2>1. Finite and Discrete Sample Space</h2>
        <p>Consider the scenario where you toss a fair coin. The outcomes are <strong>head</strong> and
            <strong>tail</strong>. These form the sample space, denoted as:
        </p>
        <div class="math">S = {Head, Tail}</div>
        <p>The number of elements in this sample space is finite, and the outcomes are discrete.</p>

        <p>Similarly, consider throwing a fair die. The sample space here is:</p>
        <div class="math">S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</div>
        <p>Again, this sample space is finite and discrete. If we define an event, such as getting an even number, the
            event can be represented as:</p>
        <div class="math">E = {2, 4, 6}</div>
        <p>Events are represented as sets. Understanding set operations is crucial, which will be covered shortly.</p>

        <h2>2. Countably Infinite Sample Space</h2>
        <p>Now, consider an experiment where you toss a fair coin until you get a head. The outcomes here are:</p>
        <div class="math">
            S = {Head, Tail Head, Tail Tail Head, Tail Tail Tail Head, ...}
        </div>
        <p>In this case, the sample space is countably infinite. Although the outcomes are infinite, they can be
            enumerated sequentially. The outcomes are discrete but infinite in number.</p>

        <h2>3. Uncountably Infinite Sample Space</h2>
        <p>Finally, consider the scenario where you randomly pick a real number between -1 and 1. The sample space is:
        </p>
        <div class="math">
            S = {x | -1 ≤ x ≤ 1}
        </div>
        <p>The outcomes in this case are uncountably infinite. You can pick a point with any precision (e.g., 0.50,
            0.52, 0.555, ...). Therefore, the sample space is continuous because the outcomes are not discrete and are
            infinite in number.</p>
    </div>


    <!--Set Operations and Properties-->
    <div class="container" id="Set Operations and Properties">
        <h1>Set Operations and Properties</h1>

        <p>So as I was mentioning to you, the elementary events, the sample space, they're all represented as sets. It's
            very important that we give a quick review of the set operations that we'll possibly consider in this
            course.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>2. Properties of Set Operations</h2>
        <p>Here are some key properties:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A ∪ A = A</strong>: The union of <strong>A</strong> with itself is <strong>A</strong>
                    itself.</li>
                <li><strong>A ∩ A = A</strong>: The intersection of <strong>A</strong> with itself is
                    <strong>A</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>A ∪ S = S</strong>: The union of <strong>A</strong> with the sample space <strong>S</strong>
                    is <strong>S</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>A ∩ S = A</strong>: The intersection of <strong>A</strong> with the sample space
                    <strong>S</strong> is <strong>A</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>A ∪ ∅ = A</strong>: The union of <strong>A</strong> with the empty set <strong>∅</strong> is
                    <strong>A</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>A ∩ ∅ = ∅</strong>: The intersection of <strong>A</strong> with the empty set
                    <strong>∅</strong> is <strong>∅</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>A ∪ B = B ∪ A</strong>: Union is commutative.</li>
                <li><strong>A ∩ B = B ∩ A</strong>: Intersection is commutative.</li>
                <li><strong>(B ∪ C) ∪ A = (A ∪ B) ∪ C</strong>: Union is associative.</li>
                <li><strong>(B ∩ C) ∩ A = (A ∩ B) ∩ C</strong>: Intersection is associative.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Distributive Properties</h2>
        <p>The distributive properties are:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>B ∩ (C ∪ A) = (B ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ A)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>B ∪ (C ∩ A) = (B ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ A)</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Complementary Properties</h2>
        <p>Complementary properties include:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A ∪ A' = S</strong>: The union of <strong>A</strong> and its complement <strong>A'</strong>
                    is the sample space <strong>S</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>A ∩ A' = ∅</strong>: The intersection of <strong>A</strong> and its complement
                    <strong>A'</strong> is the empty set <strong>∅</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h2>5. De Morgan's Laws</h2>
        <p>De Morgan's Laws state:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(A ∩ B)̅ = A' ∪ B̅</strong>: The complement of the intersection is the union of the
                    complements.</li>
                <li><strong>(A ∪ B)̅ = A' ∩ B̅</strong>: The complement of the union is the intersection of the
                    complements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="math">
            <div class="venn-diagram">
                <img src="https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/de-morgans-theorem.png"

            </div>
            <p>The Venn diagram shows an example of De Morgan's Law. If you take <strong>A ∪ B</strong> and then
                complement it, you get the same region as <strong>A' ∩ B̅</strong>. Similarly, taking the complement of
                <strong>A ∩ B</strong> gives the same result as <strong>A' ∪ B̅</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>In summary, we reviewed the basic set operations—union, intersection, and complement—along with their
            properties, identity properties, commutative properties, associative properties, distributive properties,
            and complementary properties. We also introduced De Morgan's laws.</p>

    <!--Mutually Exclusive Sets-->

    <div class="container" id="Mutually Exclusive Sets">
        <h1>Mutually Exclusive Sets and Partitioning</h1>
        <h2>1. Mutually Exclusive Sets</h2>
        <p>So now, moving on, this is a very important concept that we will keep on using in our study. We call two sets
            <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> when their intersection is <strong>∅</strong>, which is the empty set.
            For example, if you have two sets <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, and they don't overlap in their
            elements, then they are mutually exclusive. In a Venn diagram, this means that the two sets do not overlap.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h2>2. Example of Mutually Exclusive Sets</h2>
        <div class="math">
            <p>Consider the sets <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> where:</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> is the set of even numbers: {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}</li>
            <p><strong>B</strong> is the set of odd numbers: {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}</li>

            <p>The union of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> is all positive integers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
                ...}</p>
            <p>The intersection of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> is empty: <strong>A ∩ B = ∅</strong>.
                Hence, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are mutually exclusive.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>3. Partitioning a Sample Space</h2>
        <p>Moving on to how to partition a sample space. A <strong>partition</strong> of the sample space is a
            collection of mutually exclusive subsets such that their union is the entire sample space.</p>

        <div class="venn-diagram">

            <div class="math">
                <p>Consider a sample space <strong>S</strong> partitioned into <strong>N</strong> subsets: <strong>A₁,
                        A₂,
                        A₃, ..., Aₙ</strong>. These subsets are pairwise mutually exclusive, meaning:</p>

                <p><strong>Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ = ∅</strong> for any <strong>i ≠ j</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A₁ ∩ A₂ = ∅</strong> for <strong>i =1, j = 2</strong></p>

                <p>Also, their union is the entire sample space:</p>
                <p><strong>A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ ... ∪ Aₙ = S</strong></p>
                <p>This means the sample space has been partitioned into <strong>N</strong> mutually exclusive subsets.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>



        <p>To summarize:</p>
        <div class="math">

                <li><strong>Mutually exclusive sets</strong> have an empty intersection: <strong>A ∩ B = ∅</strong>.

                <li><strong>Partitioning</strong> involves dividing the sample space into mutually exclusive subsets
                    whose union covers the entire sample space.</li>

        <p>We discussed two definitions of probability: the classical definition and the relative frequency definition.
            We also categorized sample spaces into discrete and continuous types. Under discrete sample spaces, we have
            finite and countably infinite spaces. Continuous sample spaces contain uncountable and infinite outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>We previously covered set operations such as union, intersection, and complement. We also discussed mutually
            exclusive events and how to partition a sample space into mutually exclusive subsets. Now, we'll focus on
            the foundational rules, or axioms, of probability.</p>

        <h2>1. Probability Axioms</h2>
        <p>Probability is associated with an event <strong>A</strong>. It is a number that satisfies certain axioms. The
            probability measure <strong>P(A)</strong> should satisfy the following three conditions:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li>1. <strong>P(A) ≥ 0</strong>: The probability of any event <strong>A</strong> must be a non-negative
                    number.</li>
                <li>2. <strong>P(S) = 1</strong>: The probability of the entire sample space <strong>S</strong> is 1.
                </li>
                <li>3. For mutually exclusive events <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A)
                        + P(B)</strong> if <strong>A ∩ B = ∅</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h2>2. Example of Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>

        <div class="venn-diagram">

                alt="Venn Diagram Mutually Exclusive Events">
        </div>
        <p>If <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are mutually exclusive, meaning <strong>A ∩ B = ∅</strong>, the
            probability of <strong>A ∪ B</strong> is:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</strong>
        </div>
        <p>In this case, the two events do not overlap, so their intersection is empty.</p>

        <h2>3. Summary of Probability Axioms</h2>
        <p>To summarize:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Probability must be non-negative:</strong> <strong>P(A) ≥ 0</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>The probability of the sample space:</strong> <strong>P(S) = 1</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>For mutually exclusive events:</strong> <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</strong> when
                    <strong>A ∩ B = ∅</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>These axioms are crucial for understanding and working with probability. They form the foundation of
            probability theory and are used in various applications, including deriving rules for probability,
            conditioning events, and more.</p>
    </div>

    <!--Complement Rule of Probability-->
    <div class="container" id="Complement Rule of Probability">
        <h1>Complement Rule of Probability</h1>

        <p>Let's derive the complement rule for probability, which states that the probability of the complement of an
            event
            <strong>A'</strong> is given by <strong>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</strong>. Consider a set <strong>A</strong> in a
            Venn diagram representing event <strong>A</strong>.
            We know that <strong>A</strong> and its complement <strong>A'</strong> together cover the entire sample
            space <strong>S</strong>. This is a key identity
            in probability theory.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Set Identity</h2>
        <p>The union of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>A'</strong> is equal to the entire sample space, i.e.,
            <strong>A ∪ A' = S</strong>. The probability of the entire sample space is:
        </p>

        <div class="math">

            <strong>P(S) or P(Ω) = 1</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
        <p>It's important to note that <strong>A</strong> and <strong>A'</strong> are mutually exclusive, meaning they
            do not share any common elements,
            i.e., <strong>A ∩ A' = ∅</strong>. This follows from Axiom 2, which states that mutually exclusive events
            have a probability of:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>A ∩ A' = ∅</strong> <br>
            <strong>P(A ∪ A') = P(A) + P(A')</strong>
        </div>

        <p>Since <strong>A ∪ A' = S</strong>, we can substitute <strong>P(S) = 1</strong> into the equation:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>1 = P(A) + P(A')</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Deriving the Complement Rule</h2>
        <p>By rearranging the above equation, we get the complement rule:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h2>4. Example</h2>
            <p>Let's take an example where <strong>P(A) = 0.6</strong>. Then, using the complement rule, we can
                calculate:
            </p>

            <div class="math">
                <strong>P(A') = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4</strong>
            </div>

            <p>If two events are equally likely, such that <strong>P(A) = 0.5</strong>, then the probability of the
                complement is also <strong>P(A') = 0.5</strong>.</p>
        </div>

    </div>


    <!--Property: P(Φ) = 0-->
    <div class="container" id="Property: P(Φ) = 0">
        <h1>Property: P(Φ) = 0</h1>

        <p>The next property we will derive is that the probability of the empty set, <strong>P(Φ)</strong>, is equal to
            0. We have already discussed this before,
            but let's approach it from a different angle.</p>

        <h2>1. Mutually Exclusive Events Involving Φ</h2>
        <p>Consider a set <strong>A</strong>. The intersection of <strong>A</strong> and the empty set
            <strong>Φ</strong> is:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>A ∩ Φ = Φ</strong>
        </div>

        <p>This indicates that <strong>A</strong> and <strong>Φ</strong> are mutually exclusive events. Therefore, by
            Axiom 3, we can express the probability of
            their union as:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A ∪ Φ) = P(A) + P(Φ)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Using the Union of A and Φ</h2>
        <p>Since <strong>A ∪ Φ = A</strong>, we know that:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A ∪ Φ) = P(A)</strong>
        </div>

        <p>Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A) = P(A) + P(Φ)</strong>
        </div>

        <p>From this, we can conclude that:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(Φ) = 0</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Understanding the Empty Set</h2>
        <p>This result makes sense because the empty set contains no elements, meaning there are zero possible outcomes.
            Therefore, the probability of <strong>Φ</strong> must be 0.</p>

        <h2>4. Recap of Properties</h2>
        <p>We have now derived two key properties from the axioms of probability:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li>The complement rule: <strong>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</strong>.</li>
                <li>The probability of the empty set: <strong>P(Φ) = 0</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--Property: P(A ∪ B) for Non-Mutually Exclusive Sets-->
    <div class="container" id="Property: P(A ∪ B) for Non-Mutually Exclusive Sets">
        <h1>Property: P(A ∪ B) for Non-Mutually Exclusive Sets</h1>

        <p>Now, I would like to discuss the next property, which relates to the case when sets <strong>A</strong> and
            <strong>B</strong>
            are not mutually exclusive. We already know what <strong>A ∪ B</strong> is for mutually exclusive sets, as
            stated in Axiom 3. The condition for that was when <strong>A ∩ B = Φ</strong>, the probability of <strong>A
                ∪
                B</strong> is simply
            <strong>P(A) + P(B)</strong>. But what happens when <strong>A ∩ B ≠ Φ</strong>?
        </p>

        <p>This is the case when <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> overlap, meaning there is an intersection
            between
            them,
            which we denote as <strong>A ∩ B</strong>. The question is, how do we derive the expression for <strong>P(A
                ∪
                B)</strong>
            when <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are not mutually exclusive?</p>

        <p>To do this, let's introduce a shorthand notation to make the representation easier to follow.
            I will use <strong>A' ∩ B</strong> as a shorthand notation for the complement of <strong>A</strong>
            intersecting
            with <strong>B</strong>.</p>

        <h2>1. Expression for <strong>P(A ∪ B)</strong></h2>
        <p>We can now express <strong>A ∪ B</strong> as <strong>A ∪ (A' ∩ B)</strong>. This means the union of
            <strong>A</strong> and
            the complement of <strong>A</strong> intersecting with <strong>B</strong>. Visually, this covers the entire
            region of
            <strong>A ∪ B</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Now, let's examine the two regions. The first region is <strong>A</strong>, and the second region is
            <strong>A' ∩ B</strong>. These two regions are mutually exclusive, meaning their intersection is
            <strong>Φ</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Using Axiom 3, we can write:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(A' ∩ B)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Further Breakdown</h2>
        <p>Next, we need to break down the expression further. We know that <strong>A' ∩ B</strong> refers to
            the complement of <strong>A</strong> intersecting with <strong>B</strong>. Let's now consider the event
            <strong>B</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>From the identity property, we know that:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>B ∩ S = B</strong> (where <strong>S</strong> is the sample space)
        </div>

        <p>Also, we can express the sample space as <strong>A ∪ A'</strong>. Therefore, we can write:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>B ∩ (A ∪ A') = (B ∩ A) ∪ (B ∩ A') = B</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Applying Distributive Property</h2>
        <p>Now, let's visualize this on a Venn diagram. The region <strong>B ∩ A</strong> is the overlapping part of
            <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, while <strong>B ∩ A'</strong> is the part of <strong>B</strong>
            that is outside <strong>A</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>These two regions, <strong>B ∩ A</strong> and <strong>B ∩ A'</strong>, are mutually exclusive, so we can
            write,
            using Axiom 3:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ A')</strong>
        </div>

        <p>We know that <strong>B ∩ A'</strong> is the same as <strong>A' ∩ B</strong>. Therefore, we can express
            <strong>P(A' ∩ B)</strong> as:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A' ∩ B) = P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Final Expression</h2>
        <p>Now, substituting this back into our original expression for <strong>P(A ∪ B)</strong>, we get:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</strong>
        </div>

        <p>This gives us the expression for the probability of the union of two events that are not mutually exclusive.
        </p>
    </div>



    <!--Property: P(A) ≤ P(B) if A ⊆ B-->
    <div class="container" id="Property: P(A) ≤ P(B) if A ⊆ B">
        <h1>Property: P(A) ≤ P(B) if A ⊆ B</h1>

        <p>We have considered the scenario when <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are not mutually exclusive
            events. We showed that
            <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</strong>. Now, we will move on to the last property of probability
            that we can derive from
            the axioms.
        </p>

        <p>This property states that if you have an event <strong>A</strong> where the elements of <strong>A</strong>
            are contained within <strong>B</strong>, or
            <strong>A</strong> is a subset of <strong>B</strong>, then we can show that:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A) ≤ P(B)</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <p>For example, consider a fair die. The sample space <strong>Ω</strong> is <strong>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
                    6}</strong>.
                Let <strong>A</strong> be the event of
                getting a {2}, and let <strong>B</strong> be the event of getting an even number <strong>{2, 4,
                    6}</strong>.
                Here, <strong>A</strong> is clearly a subset of <strong>B</strong>,
                so we can say that <strong>P(A) ≤ P(B)</strong>.</p>

            <p>For <strong>A = {2}</strong>, <strong>P(A) = 1/6</strong>, and for <strong>B = {2, 4, 6}</strong>,
                <strong>P(B) = 3/6</strong>. Clearly, <strong>1/6 &lt; 3/6</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>1. Proof from Axioms</h2>
        <p>We will now prove this from the axioms of probability. Suppose <strong>A</strong> is contained within
            <strong>B</strong>. Then:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>A ∪ A' ∩ B = B</strong>
        </div>

        <p>Where <strong>A'B</strong> denotes the region of <strong>B</strong> that does not include <strong>A</strong>
            (i.e., <strong>A' ∩ B</strong>). The union of <strong>A</strong> and
            <strong>A' ∩ B</strong> gives <strong>B</strong>. Also, note that <strong>A</strong> and
            <strong>A'B</strong>
            are mutually exclusive, meaning:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>A ∩ A' ∩ B = Φ</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Invoking Axiom 3</h2>
        <p>Since <strong>A</strong> and <strong>A' ∩ B</strong> are mutually exclusive, we can apply Axiom 3 to write:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(B) = P(A) + P(A' ∩ B)</strong>
        </div>

        <p>Since <strong>P(A' ∩ B) ≥ 0</strong>, it follows that <strong>P(B) ≥ P(A)</strong>. This proves that if
            <strong>A ⊆ B</strong>, then:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A) ≤ P(B)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Recap</h2>
        <p>We have derived this important property of probability, which states that if <strong>A</strong> is a subset
            of <strong>B</strong>, then the probability of
            <strong>A</strong> is less than or equal to the probability of <strong>B</strong>. Remember the three axioms
            of probability as we conclude:
        </p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>P(A) ≥ 0</strong> (Non-negative)</li>
                <li><strong>P(Ω) = 1</strong> (Probability of the sample space is 1)</li>
                <li>If <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are mutually exclusive, then <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) +
                        P(B)</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>These axioms are fundamental in deriving all properties of probability.</p>

    <!--Review of Probability Axioms-->
    <div class="container" id="Review of Probability Axioms">
        <h1>Review of Probability Axioms</h1>

        <p>Welcome back. Let's review the axioms of probability once again. For any event <strong>A</strong>, we can
            assign a number called
            the probability of the event. This number, called the probability measure, must satisfy the following three
            conditions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The number must be non-negative, meaning it must be greater than or equal to 0.</li>
            <li>The probability of the whole set, defined as the sample space, must be 1.</li>

        </ul>
        <div class="math">
            If <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are two mutually exclusive events (i.e., <strong>A ∩ B =
                Φ</strong>), then the probability of
            <strong>A ∪ B</strong> will be <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</strong>.
        </div>

        <p>Based on these axioms, we previously derived several important rules pertaining to probability.</p>

        <h2>1. Probability of the Complement</h2>
        <p>The probability of the complement of event <strong>A</strong> is given by:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Non-Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
        <p>For events <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> that are not mutually exclusive (i.e., <strong>A ∩ B ≠
                Φ</strong>), we have the following rule:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Sample Space Overview</h2>
        <p>We also discussed the concept of a sample space, which can be:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li>Discrete finite</li>
                <li>Discrete infinite</li>
                <li>Continuous</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>4. Examples</h2>
        <p>In this part, I will now work through a few examples to illustrate the concepts we've discussed so far. I
            will take up
            two examples to demonstrate these ideas.</p>
