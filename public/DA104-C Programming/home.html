        <h1>Welcome to DA 104 - C Programming Course</h1>
        <p>Hello learners, welcome to the course DA 104, the C programming course.</p>
        <p class="professor">I am Ashok Singh Sairam, a professor in the department of mathematics at IIT Guwahati. I am
            also an associate faculty in the Meta family School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIT
            Guwahati.</p>

        <div class="course-info">
            <p>This course is self-contained, meaning for this course you do not need any background knowledge of
                computers or programming. If you have done a course on programming before, well and good. Otherwise, you
                need not worry. We will start the course from the fundamental concepts.</p>
            <p>We learn the grammar of the language, that is lexical elements. We learn the data types which are
                available in C. Then how to control the flow of the program using control statements. Then we learn how
                to write modular programs using functions in C.</p>
            <p>As the course progresses, we will learn more advanced topics such as arrays, pointers, and strings.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In this course, we lay great emphasis on practicals. In every module, there will be programming assignments
            on the topics covered. Although these assignments are for practice, you are highly encouraged to write the
            code yourselves. This will give you a firm grip on the language.</p>
        <p>The programming assignments will be on Linux using the platform available on Coursera. For compilation, we
            will be using the GNU C compiler which is freely available. Thus, for labs, you do not need any additional
            setup.</p>
        <p>I hope you all will enjoy learning this course, thank you.</p>
