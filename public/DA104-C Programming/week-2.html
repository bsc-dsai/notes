    <!-- Lexical Elements in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Lexical Elements">
        <h1>Week 2: Lexical Elements in C Programming</h1>

        <p>In the first Week, we learned how to write a basic C program and the structure of a basic C program. We are
            now ready for our second Week, which is on <strong>lexical elements</strong>. What are lexical elements?
            By lexical elements, we mean the basic building blocks of a C program.</p>

        <p>Lexical elements are the <strong>basic building blocks</strong> of a C program or, for that matter, any
            programming language. A C program can be thought of as made up of six types of building blocks. These
            building blocks in C are called <strong>tokens</strong>. In this Week, we will be understanding all six
            building blocks. Tokens are the basic building blocks of the language. They are also the <strong>smallest
                units of a C program that have meaning</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Lexical Analysis and Compilation Process</h2>
        <p>During the compilation process, the compiler breaks the C source code into tokens through a process called
            <strong>lexical analysis</strong>. Now, let's look at the compilation process. How does the compiler compile
            a program?
        </p>

        <p>We have the <strong>source code</strong>. What is the source code? The source code can be thought of as a
            sequence of characters, such as <code>int</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>void</code>, etc. These
            characters are grouped into tokens by the compiler. For example, in a C program:</p>

        <pre><code>int main() { 
        // Your code here
    }</code></pre>
        <div class="math">
            <div class="venn-diagram">
                <img src="images/flow.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>This is a sequence of characters. The compiler will group these characters into tokens:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>int</code> - This is one token (a keyword).</li>
            <li><code>main</code> - This is one token (an identifier).</li>
            <li><code>()</code> - These are tokens (punctuators).</li>
            <li><code>{}</code> - These are tokens (operators).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The compiler groups these characters into tokens, which are the basic vocabulary of the language. It then
            translates these tokens into object codes. For example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>int</code> is a <strong>keyword</strong> (a token).</li>
            <li><code>main</code> is an <strong>identifier</strong> (a token).</li>
            <li><code>()</code> are <strong>operators</strong> (tokens).</li>
            <li><code>{}</code> are <strong>punctuators</strong> (tokens).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In summary, a C program can be thought of as a sequence of characters, and the compiler groups them into
            tokens. Each of these tokens is translated into codes.</p>

        <h2>Types of Tokens in C</h2>
        <p>In C, there are <strong>six types of tokens</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keywords</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Punctuators</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Identifiers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Constants</strong></li>
            <li><strong>String Constants</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Operators</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will be looking into each of these tokens in the upcoming videos.</p>
    </div>



    <!-- Keywords in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Keywords">
        <h1>Week 2: Keywords in C Programming</h1>

        <p>In this second video, we'll study in detail the first type of token, that is, <strong>keywords</strong>. What
            are keywords? Keywords are predefined or reserved words that have special meaning. They are reserved words
            and they have a special meaning. For example, if I say <code>int</code>, it always means integer. It cannot
            mean anything else.</p>

        <p>In C, there are <strong>32 keywords</strong>, which is relatively fewer compared to other languages. That's
            why we also call C a <strong>small language</strong>. As we progress in this course, we'll understand each
            of these keywords and why we call C a small language, because in other languages, the number of keywords is
            almost double. But here, we only need to learn these 32 keywords.</p>
        <div class="math">
            <div class="venn-diagram">
                <img src="images/flow2.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Categorizing Keywords</h2>
        <p>Let's try to categorize these keywords in different ways. One way is to categorize them depending on whether
            they're related to <strong>data types</strong>. Data types refer to the types of identifiers. In this
            particular slide, I've marked out all the keywords that are related to data types.</p>

        <p>Some specific keywords you'll encounter include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>auto</code></li>
            <li><code>extern</code></li>
            <li><code>register</code></li>
            <li><code>static</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These keywords are encountered when we study functions, and we'll cover them in detail when we look at
            functions.</p>

        <h2>Program Example: Calculating Area of a Circle</h2>
        <p>Now, we have a program here that I'm going to use as a running example to identify all the tokens. This
            program computes the area of a circle. Let's look at this program in detail.</p>

        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
// This program computes the area of a circle
int main() {
    float area, radius, pi;
    radius = 5;
    pi = 3.14;
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
    printf("\nArea of the circle: %f"\n, area);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

        <h2>Comments in C</h2>
        <p>The first line is a pre-processing directive. The second line is a <strong>comment</strong>. What are
            comments? Comments are used for adding notes or explanations within the code. For example,
            <code>// This program computes the area of a circle</code> helps us understand the purpose of the program.
        </p>

        <p>Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the program. There are two types of comments in C:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-line comments</strong> - Anything written between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> is a
                multi-line comment.</li>
            <li><strong>Single-line comments</strong> - Anything written after <code>//</code> is a single-line comment.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>int radius; // This is the radius of the circle</code></pre>

        <h2>Identifying Keywords</h2>
        <p>Returning to our example program, I've identified all the keywords. Here are the keywords marked in blue:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>int</code> - a keyword</li>
            <li><code>main</code> - a keyword</li>
            <li><code>float</code> - a keyword</li>
            <li><code>return</code> - a keyword</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What's a C program? It's a sequence of characters that can be broken down into tokens. We've identified the
            first type of token, which is <strong>keywords</strong>. In the next video, we'll look at the second type of
            tokens, which are <strong>punctuators</strong>.</p>
    </div>




    <!-- Punctuators in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Punctuators">
        <h1>Week 2: Punctuators in C Programming</h1>

        <p>In this video, we look at the second type of tokens, that is, <strong>punctuators</strong>. Punctuators in C
            have a role very similar to that of punctuation in English. Punctuators are used to separate or punctuate
            the code. What's a punctuator? It has a <strong>semantic significance</strong>, but does not specify an
            operation to be performed.</p>

        <p>By semantic significance, I mean it has meaning. For example, if I write <code>int radius;</code>, it means
            this is the end of the statement. It has meaning but it does not perform any operation. That's what I mean
            by it having significant semantic significance, but not specifying any operation. Punctuators are used to
            group tokens or terminate a list of tokens, as you can see in this example.</p>

        <h2>Types of Punctuators in C</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Braces { }</strong> - Braces are used to indicate the start and end of a compound statement. A
                compound statement consists of multiple statements. For example, in a <code>for</code> loop (we will
                discuss <code>for</code> loops later), multiple statements can be grouped together using braces.
                Statements within braces are also known as <strong>code blocks</strong>.</li>

            <li><strong>Semicolon ;</strong> - The semicolon is used to terminate statements. For example,
                <code>int radius;</code> terminates the statement.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Comma ,</strong> - The comma can be used both as a <strong>separator</strong> and as an
                <strong>operator</strong>. In this course, we will primarily use the comma as a separator. For example,
                <code>int radius, area;</code> separates multiple variables in a single declaration.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Colon :</strong> - The colon is used in <strong>conditional statements</strong>, like in
                <code>switch-case</code> statements. It is also used in <strong>label statements</strong> when using the
                <code>goto</code> statement. For example, <code>start:</code> indicates a label named "start".
            </li>

            <li><strong>Hash #</strong> - We've already seen the hash symbol in pre-processing directives. It is used to
                include libraries, like <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>.</li>

            <li><strong>Angle Brackets &lt; &gt;</strong> - Angle brackets are used in pre-processing directives to
                include files, as in <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>.</li>

            <li><strong>Parentheses ( )</strong> - Parentheses have two main uses: <strong>grouping expressions</strong>
                and <strong>specifying
                    function parameters</strong>. For example, in <code>(x * y) / z</code>, the parentheses group the
                expression
                <code>x * y</code>. Parentheses are also used when defining or calling functions, such as in
                <code>main()</code> or when specifying function parameters.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example: Identifying Punctuators in a Program</h2>
        <p>Let's return to our running example program, which computes the area of a circle. Here, we can identify the
            punctuators:</p>

        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
// This program computes the area of a circle
int main() {
    float area, radius, pi;
    radius = 5;
    pi = 3.14;
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
    printf("\nArea of the circle: %f"\n, area);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the punctuators are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>{ }</code> - Used to indicate the start and end of a compound statement.</li>
            <li><code>;</code> - Used to terminate statements.</li>
            <li><code>,</code> - Used to separate variables.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All the punctuators in this program are marked in green so that you can easily identify them. Punctuators
            play a key role in structuring C programs.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Identifiers in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Identifiers">
        <h1>Week 2: Identifiers in C Programming</h1>

        <p>In this video, we'll study the third type of token, that is, <strong>identifiers</strong>. What are
            identifiers? Identifiers are names that are given to programming elements, particularly used for variables
            and functions. Identifiers provide unique names to objects in a program. By "objects," we mean variables or
            function names.</p>

        <p>There are two rules to define an identifier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It should be composed of letters, digits, and the special character <strong>underscore</strong>
                (<code>_</code>).</li>
            <li>An identifier must start with either a letter or an underscore. The first character of an identifier
                should be one of these two.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples of Valid Identifiers</h2>
        <p>Let's look at some examples of valid identifiers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>a</code> - This is a valid identifier as it starts with a letter.</li>
            <li><code>b</code> - Another valid identifier.</li>
            <li><code>principle</code> - A valid identifier that starts with letters.</li>
            <li><code>i123</code> - A mix of letters and digits, which is allowed.</li>
            <li><code>i123_xyz</code> - A valid identifier combining letters, digits, and an underscore.</li>
            <li><code>_var</code> - Valid as it starts with an underscore.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples of Invalid Identifiers</h2>
        <p>Here are examples of invalid identifiers and why they are not allowed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>1ixyz</code> - Invalid because it starts with a digit. The first character must be a letter or
                underscore.</li>
            <li><code>not#me</code> - Invalid because it contains a special character <code>#</code>, which is not
                allowed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>An identifier cannot start with anything other than a letter or an underscore, and it cannot contain special
            characters other than the underscore. It should only include letters, digits, and underscores.</p>

        <h2>Example: Identifying Identifiers in a Program</h2>
        <p>Now let's return to our running example of computing the area of a circle. Here, we'll identify the
            identifiers used in the program:</p>

        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include <stdio.h>
// This program computes the area of a circle
int main() {
    float area, radius, pi;
    radius = 5;
    pi = 3.14;
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
    printf("\nArea of the circle: %f"\n, area);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the identifiers are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>main</code> - This is the name of the function.</li>
            <li><code>radius</code> - This is the name of a variable.</li>
            <li><code>area</code> - Another variable used in the program.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All the identifiers are marked in a different color to distinguish them easily. Identifiers are crucial for
            naming variables and functions in a meaningful way, making the code more readable and easier to document.
        </p>

        <h2>Choosing Meaningful Identifiers</h2>
        <p>When selecting names for identifiers, choose names that are meaningful. For example, if a variable represents
            the radius of a circle, use <code>radius</code> as the identifier instead of something like <code>ABC</code>
            or <code>XYZ</code>. Meaningful identifiers enhance the readability and documentation of your program. Use
            names like <code>radius</code>, <code>area</code>, or <code>circle</code> for clarity and purpose.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Constants and String Constants in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Constants">
        <h1>Week 2: Constants and String Constants in C Programming</h1>

        <p>So far, we have seen three types of tokens: <strong>keywords</strong>, <strong>punctuators</strong>, and
            <strong>identifiers</strong>. In this video, we'll be looking at the fourth one, which is
            <strong>constants</strong>, and the fifth one, which is <strong>string constants</strong>. Constants and
            string constants are the two types of tokens we'll explore in this video.
        </p>

        <h2>Constants</h2>
        <p>Constants are fixed values that cannot be altered during the execution of a program. There are several types
            of constants:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Integer Constants</strong>: These represent whole numbers. Integer constants can be written in
                different bases:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decimal (Base 10)</strong>: For example, <code>0</code>, <code>77</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Octal (Base 8)</strong>: Octal constants start with a zero, such as <code>0123</code>.
                        In decimal, this would be calculated as <code>1(8^2) + 2(8^1) + 3(8^0)</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hexadecimal (Base 16)</strong>: Hexadecimal constants start with <code>0x</code>. For
                        example, <code>0xfff</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Floating Point Constants</strong>: These are real numbers with decimal points. For example,
                <code>345.5</code> is a floating point constant.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Character Constants</strong>: Individual characters enclosed in single quotes. Examples include
                <code>'a'</code>, <code>'b'</code>, <code>'\n'</code>, and <code>'\t'</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>String Constants</h2>
        <p>String constants consist of more than one character enclosed in a pair of double quotes. For example,
            <code>"hello"</code> is a string constant. A <strong>null string</strong> is an empty sequence of characters
            enclosed in double quotes, like <code>""</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Example: Identifying Constants in a Program</h2>
        <p>Let's return to our running example of computing the area of a circle and identify the constants:</p>

        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
// This program computes the area of a circle
int main() {
    float area, radius, pi;
    radius = 5;
    pi = 3.14;
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
    printf("\nArea of the circle: %f"\n, area);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the constants are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>5</code> - This is an integer constant, specifically a decimal constant.</li>
            <li><code>3.14</code> - This is a floating point constant.</li>
            <li><code>"Area of the circle: %f"</code> - This is a string constant, enclosed within double quotes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this program, we have identified the <strong>keywords</strong>, <strong>identifiers</strong>,
            <strong>punctuators</strong>, and now the <strong>constants</strong> and <strong>string constants</strong>.
            The remaining elements are operators, which we'll cover in detail in a future video.

        <h1>Week 2: Operators in C Programming</h1>

        <p>So far, we have seen five types of tokens: <strong>keywords</strong>, <strong>punctuators</strong>,
            <strong>identifiers</strong>, <strong>constants</strong>, and <strong>string constants</strong>. In this
            video, we'll start with <strong>operators</strong>, which are perhaps the most important of all the token
            types. There are different types of operators, and in subsequent videos, we'll learn how to use them.
        </p>

        <h2>What are Operators?</h2>
        <p>An operator is a token that specifies an operation on at least one <strong>operand</strong> and yields a
            result. For example:</p>

        <pre><code>c = a + b;</code></pre>

        <p>Here, the <code>+</code> is an <strong>operator</strong> that specifies an operation between two operands,
            <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Operators act on operands to perform calculations or operations. In this
            case:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operands</strong>: <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the operands.</li>
            <li><strong>Operator</strong>: <code>+</code> is the operator.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Operands can also be constants. For example, you could write:</p>

        <pre><code>c = a + 5;</code></pre>

        <p>Here, <code>a</code> is a variable, and <code>5</code> is a constant operand. Since the operator acts on two
            operands, it is called a <strong>binary operator</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Unary Operators</h2>
        <p>An operator that acts on a single operand is called a <strong>unary operator</strong>. For example:</p>

        <pre><code>c = a++;</code></pre>

        <p>In this case, the <code>++</code> operator acts on a single operand <code>a</code>, making it a unary
            operator.</p>

        <h2>Example: Identifying Operators</h2>
        <p>Let's look at our running example of the area of a circle and identify the operators:</p>

        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
// This program computes the area of a circle
int main() {
    int radius = 5;
    float area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
    printf("Area of the circle: %f", area);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the following are operators:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>()</code> - These parentheses are operators used to call a function.</li>
            <li><code>=</code> - This is an <strong>assignment operator</strong>, used to assign values to variables.
            </li>
            <li><code>*</code> - This is a <strong>multiplication operator</strong>, which is an arithmetic operator.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We'll explore different types of operators, such as arithmetic, logical, and relational operators, in future
            videos.</p>

        <h2>Summary: Tokens in C Programming</h2>
        <p>To sum up our example of the area of a circle, we have learned that a C program is a sequence of characters.
            The compiler groups these characters into tokens, each belonging to one of the six types of tokens:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keywords</strong> - Highlighted in blue.</li>
            <li><strong>Punctuators</strong> - Highlighted in green.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> - Highlighted in orange.</li>
            <li><strong>Constants</strong> - Highlighted in purple.</li>
            <li><strong>Operators</strong> - Highlighted in black.</li>

        <p>The first line is a preprocessing directive, and the second line is a comment. Comments are not processed by
            the compiler but make the code more readable. Always include comments in your programs to enhance

    <!-- Unary and Arithmetic Operators in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Operators">
        <h1>Week 2: Unary and Arithmetic Operators in C Programming</h1>

        <p>There are different operators in C. In this video, we'll learn about the <strong>unary operators</strong> and
            <strong>arithmetic operators</strong>. In the last video, we discussed unary operators. A unary operator
            operates on a single operand. Arithmetic operators, on the other hand, are binary operators, meaning they
            operate on two operands.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Operators</strong> have rules of precedence and associativity:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <div class="venn-diagram">
                <img src="images/flow4.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Precedence</strong>: The operator with higher precedence is executed first if multiple operators
                appear together.</li>
            <li><strong>Associativity</strong>: Most operators follow <strong>left-to-right associativity</strong>,
                except for unary and prefix operators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example: Precedence and Associativity</h2>
        <p>Let's look at an example to explain precedence and associativity:</p>

        <pre><code>a * b / c;</code></pre>
        <p>Here, both multiplication and division have the same precedence, but they are evaluated from <strong>left to
                right</strong>. So, the result of <code>a * b</code> is computed first, then divided by <code>c</code>.
            This is an example of associativity.</p>

        <pre><code>a + b / c;</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, division has higher precedence than addition. Therefore, <code>b / c</code> is computed first,
            and then the result is added to <code>a</code>. This demonstrates precedence.</p>

        <h2>Increment and Decrement Operators</h2>
        <p><strong>Increment</strong> (<code>++</code>) and <strong>decrement</strong> (<code>--</code>) operators can
            be used as both suffix (postfix) and prefix operators:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Postfix</strong>: The operation is performed after the statement is executed.</li>
            <li><strong>Prefix</strong>: The operation is performed before the statement is executed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Postfix Example</h3>
        <pre><code>c = a++;</code></pre>
        <p>If <code>a</code> is <code>5</code>, then <code>c</code> will get the value <code>5</code>, and
            <code>a</code> will be incremented to <code>6</code> after the statement is executed.
        </p>

        <h3>Prefix Example</h3>
        <pre><code>c = ++a;</code></pre>
        <p>If <code>a</code> is <code>5</code>, <code>c</code> will get the value <code>6</code>, as <code>a</code> is
            incremented before the statement is executed.</p>

        <h2>Modulo Operator</h2>
        <p>The <strong>modulo operator</strong> (<code>%</code>) returns the remainder of a division. For example:</p>

        <pre><code>c = 2 % 3;</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, <code>2 % 3</code> gives a remainder of <code>2</code>, so <code>c</code> will be
            <code>2</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Detailed Examples</h2>
        <div class="math">

            <h3>Example 1: Integer Division</h3>
            <pre><code>a * b / c;</code></pre>
            <p>If <code>a = 1</code>, <code>b = 2</code>, and <code>c = 3</code>, <code>a * b = 2</code>, and
                <code>2 / 3</code> is an integer division, so the result will be <code>0</code>.

                <code>a * b = 2</code>,
                then <code>2 % 3 = 2</code>, and finally <code>2 + 1 = 3</code>.

            <p>If <code>a = 1</code>, <code>b = 2</code>, and <code>c = 3</code>, the postfix increment will occur after
                the
                statement. So, first, compute <code>a * b = 2</code>, and <code>c--</code> will remain <code>3</code>
                during
                this statement.</p>

                compute
                <code>5 * -b</code> (with <code>b</code> as <code>-2</code>), which gives <code>-10</code>. Finally,
                compute
                <code>7 + 10 = 17</code>.

    <!-- Assignment Operator in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Assignment Operators">
        <h1>Week 2: Assignment Operator in C Programming</h1>

        <p>In this video, we'll examine the <strong>assignment operator</strong>. C treats the <code>=</code> (equal to
            sign) as an operator.</p>

        <p>The syntax is: the variable will be on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side, we can have a constant
            or expression. <br> <strong>variable = constant or expression</strong>. For example, let's say we have a
            variable named <code>radius</code>: </pre>
        </p>
        <pre><code>radius = 5;</code></pre>

        <p>Here, we have the variable on the left-hand side and a constant on the right-hand side. We can also have an
            expression on the right-hand side. The <strong>associativity of the assignment operator</strong> is from
            <strong>right to
                left</strong>. This means that if we have multiple assignment operators in an expression, the evaluation
            starts from right to left.
        </p>

        <h2>Example: Multiple Assignments</h2>
        <p>Consider this expression:</p>

        <pre><code>a = b = c;</code></pre>
        <p>Assume the value of <code>b = 3</code> and <code>c = 5</code>. Since the associativity is from right to left,
            the expression will first assign <code>c</code> to <code>b</code>. After that, <code>a</code> will get the
            value of <code>b</code>, which is now <code>5</code>. At the end of this execution, the result will be:</p>

        <pre><code>a = 5, b = 5, c = 5;</code></pre>

        <h2>Compound Assignment Operators</h2>
        <p>The assignment operator also has <strong>compound forms</strong> such as <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>,
            <code>*=</code>, etc. Let’s take an example of <code>+=</code>:
        </p>

        <pre><code>c += 5;</code></pre>
        <p>This is a shorthand for:</p>

        <pre><code>c = c + 5;</code></pre>
        <p>If the previous value of <code>c</code> was <code>2</code>, after this statement, the value of <code>c</code>
            becomes <code>7</code>.</p>

        <h2>Example: Multiplication Compound Assignment</h2>
        <p>Let's take another example with multiplication:</p>

        <pre><code>j *= k + 3;</code></pre>
        <p>This expands to:</p>

        <pre><code>j = j * (k + 3);</code></pre>
        <p>If <code>j = 2</code> and <code>k = 3</code>, the evaluation happens as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, <code>k + 3</code> is evaluated (since <code>*</code> has higher precedence than <code>+</code>).
            </li>
            <li>Then, the result of <code>k + 3</code> is multiplied by <code>j</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, <code>j * (3 + 3) = 2 * 6 = 12</code>. Therefore, the final value of <code>j</code> will be
            <code>12</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Operator Table and Precedence</h2>
        <p>We have already seen basic arithmetic operators like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>,
            <code>/</code>, and <code>%</code> (modulo). In the table of operators, the assignment operator
            (<code>=</code>) has the <strong>lowest precedence</strong> of all operators, and its associativity is from
            <strong>right to left</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>In the next video, we’ll be exploring more operators.</p>
    </div>



    <!-- Relational Operator in C Programming -->
    <div class="container" id="C Programming Relational Operators">
        <h1>Week 2: Relational Operator in C Programming</h1>

        <p>In this video, we will be looking at one more operator, the <strong>relational operator</strong>. These
            operators are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. They are often used when
            we create conditional statements or expressions. We will learn more about conditional statements in later
            videos.</p>

        <p>The associativity of relational operators is from <strong>left to right</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Relational Operators</h2>
        <p>There are four relational operators:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;=</code></li>
            <li><code>&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&gt;=</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let’s take an example:</p>
        <pre><code>10 &gt; 7  // True</code></pre>
        <p>This expression will evaluate to <strong>True</strong>.</p>

        <p>Another example:</p>
        <pre><code>7 &gt;= 7  // True</code></pre>
        <p>This will also evaluate to <strong>True</strong>.</p>

        <p>However, an expression like:</p>
        <pre><code>7 &gt; 10  // False</code></pre>
        <p>Will evaluate to <strong>False</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>True</strong> is usually represented as <code>1</code> or any non-zero value, while
            <strong>False</strong> is represented as <code>0</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Operator Precedence</h2>
        <p>In the operator precedence table, relational operators have a higher precedence than the assignment operator.
            Their associativity is from <strong>left to right</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Relational Expressions</h2>
        <p>Let’s explore how these relational expressions are evaluated. Consider two variables, <code>a</code> and
            <code>b</code>, with some examples:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If <code>a = 5</code> and <code>b = 2</code>, then:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>a &lt; b</code> will evaluate to <code>0</code> (False).</li>
                <li><code>a &gt; b</code> will evaluate to <code>1</code> (True).</li>
                <li><code>a &lt;= b</code> will evaluate to <code>0</code>.</li>
                <li><code>a &gt;= b</code> will evaluate to <code>1</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If <code>a = 5</code> and <code>b = 5</code>, then:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>a &lt; b</code> will evaluate to <code>0</code>.</li>
                <li><code>a &gt; b</code> will evaluate to <code>0</code>.</li>
                <li><code>a &lt;= b</code> will evaluate to <code>1</code>.</li>
                <li><code>a &gt;= b</code> will evaluate to <code>1</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If <code>a = 2</code> and <code>b = 5</code>, then:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>a &lt; b</code> will evaluate to <code>1</code>.</li>
                <li><code>a &gt; b</code> will evaluate to <code>0</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>ASCII Values in Relational Expressions</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, you'll see expressions with characters in single quotes, like <code>'a'</code>. These are
            character constants, which represent ASCII values.</p>

        <p><strong>ASCII</strong> stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a character
            encoding standard where characters (letters, digits, symbols, or control characters) are represented by
            numeric values. Computers only understand binary, so each character is assigned a unique <strong>7-bit
                binary number</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Example: ASCII Values in Expressions</h2>
        <p>Let’s look at this expression:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>'a' + 1 &lt; 'w'</code></pre>
            <p>The ASCII value of <code>'a'</code> is <code>97</code>, and for <code>'w'</code>, it’s <code>119</code>.
                So
                the expression becomes:</p>
            <pre><code>97 + 1 &lt; 119</code></pre>
            <p>This evaluates to <code>98 &lt; 119</code>, which is <strong>True</strong> (1).</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Additional Relational Expression Examples</h2>
        <p>Let’s evaluate some more complex expressions:</p>
        <pre><code>-i - 5 * j &gt;= k + 1</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>If <code>i = 1</code>, <code>j = 2</code>, and <code>k = -7</code>, this expands to:</li>
            <li><code>-1 - 5 * 2 &gt;= -7 + 1</code></li>
            <li>First, multiplication has higher precedence, so this becomes:</li>
            <li><code>-1 - 10 &gt;= -6</code></li>
            <li>Now, the subtraction:</li>
            <li><code>-11 &gt;= -6</code>, which is <strong>False</strong> (0).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Another example:</p>
        <pre><code>3 &lt; j &lt; 5</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>If <code>j = 2</code>, the expression becomes:</li>
            <li><code>3 &lt; 2 &lt; 5</code></li>
            <li>Since <code>3 &lt; 2</code> is <strong>False</strong> (0), this simplifies to:</li>
            <li><code>0 &lt; 5</code>, which is <strong>True</strong> (1).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Unexpected Results</h2>
        <p>Lastly, let’s look at this expression:</p>
        <p>x = 7e + 33, y = 0.001</p>
        <pre><code>x &lt; x + y</code></pre>
        <p>Where <code>x</code> is a very large number and <code>y</code> is small. Due to the limitations in the
            machine's representation of numbers, <code>y</code> may be ignored. This causes the expression to evaluate
            as:</p>
        <pre><code>x &lt; x</code></pre>
        <p>Which is <strong>False</strong> (0), resulting in an unexpected outcome.</p>

        <p>In this video, we have looked at relational expressions and explored various examples. That’s all for this
            video.</p>

        <h1>Week 2: Equality and Logical Operators</h1>

        <p>In this video, we'll look into two operators: the equality operator and the logical operator. The equality
            and the logical operators are used to compare values and make decisions based on the comparison result.</p>

        <h2>Equality Operators</h2>
        <p>We have two equality operators:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equal to (==):</strong> Checks if the two values are equal. For example, if <code>7 == 7</code>,
                this evaluates to true. It checks if the expression on the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand
                side, and if that is true, then it will evaluate to true.</li>
            <li><strong>Not equal to (!=):</strong> Checks if the two values are not equal. For example, if
                <code>7 != 6</code>, this is true because 7 is not equal to 6. This will evaluate to true.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are binary operators and yield either true or false. They take two operands.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Consider the expression <code>i + j + k == -2 * -k</code> with <code>i = 1</code>, <code>j = 2</code>, and
            <code>k = 3</code>. Let's evaluate:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Left-hand side: <code>i + j + k</code> = <code>1 + 2 + 3</code> = 6</li>
            <li>Right-hand side: <code>-2 * -k</code> = <code>-2 * -3</code> = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The expression evaluates to <code>6 == 6</code>, which is true.</p>

        <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
        <p>There are three logical operators:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logical NOT (!):</strong> A unary operator that works on a single operand. If the operand is
                zero, <code>!a</code> evaluates to true (1). If the operand is non-zero, <code>!a</code> evaluates to
                false (0).</li>
            <li><strong>Logical AND (&&):</strong> A binary operator that returns true if both conditions are true. It
                has a higher precedence than logical OR.</li>
            <li><strong>Logical OR (||):</strong> A binary operator that returns true if at least one of the conditions
                is true. It has a lower precedence than logical AND.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Operator Precedence and Associativity</h3>
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Operator</th>
                    <th>Precedence</th>
                    <th>Associativity</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Logical NOT (!)</td>
                    <td>Highest (same as unary operators)</td>
                    <td>Right to Left</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Logical AND (&&)</td>
                    <td>Higher</td>
                    <td>Left to Right</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Logical OR (||)</td>
                    <td>Lower</td>
                    <td>Left to Right</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Equality (==, !=)</td>
                    <td>Lower than relational operators</td>
                    <td>Left to Right</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>Let's look at some examples to understand how these operators work:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Expression:</strong> <code>i && j && k</code> with <code>i = 3</code>, <code>j = 3</code>, and
                <code>k = 3</code>. This evaluates to true because all operands are non-zero.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Expression:</strong> <code>x || (i && (j - 3))</code> with <code>x = 0.0</code>,
                <code>i = 3</code>, <code>j = 3</code>. This evaluates to false because <code>3 - 3</code> is zero and
                <code>0 || 0</code> is false.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Expression:</strong> <code>i < j || x < y</code> with <code>i = 3</code>, <code>j = 3</code>,
                <code>x = 0.0</code>, and <code>y = 2.3</code>. This evaluates to true because <code>3 < 3</code> is
                false but <code>0.0 < 2.3</code> is true.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Expression:</strong> <code>(c - 1) || (c + 1)</code> with <code>c = 66</code>. This evaluates to
                true because <code>66 - 1</code> is true, so the overall expression evaluates to true without needing to
                evaluate the second part.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In this video, we have covered two types of operators: equality operators and logical operators. We have seen
            examples of how these operators are evaluated and how their precedence and associativity affect the result.
