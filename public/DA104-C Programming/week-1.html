        <h1>Week 1: Computer System Fundamentals Part 1</h1>

        <p>We have had an overview of how the course will run in the last few videos. Today we are ready to start with
            the actual learning. We'll begin with some computer system fundamentals. We'll have an overview of what a
            computer system is, including its hardware and software components. However, learning the entire computer
            system is a huge task, so we'll focus on the computer system from the perspective of programming.</p>
        <h2>Overview of Computer System Components</h2>
        <p>A computer system, as you can see, consists of four main components. At the top, we have the users— that's
            you and me. The users generally interact with an application software, but they can also interact directly
            with the operating system. The application software runs on top of the operating system, and the operating
            system controls the hardware. This is how the entire system works together.</p>
        <h2>Examples of Application Software</h2>
        <p>Some examples of application software include Microsoft Word. In this course, we'll be using a compiler
            extensively, and a compiler is also an example of application software.</p>
        <h2>Examples of Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and so on. Finally, we have hardware.
            The hardware we are considering here includes your laptop or desktop.</p>
        <h2>Hardware: System Unit</h2>
        <p>Let's look in more detail at the hardware. The hardware components of a computer system include your monitor,
            keyboard, and speakers, but our primary focus is the system unit. While it's often called the CPU, its
            actual name is the system unit.</p>
        <h3>Power Supply (SMPS)</h3>
        <p>One of the first things we'll see inside the system unit is the power supply, also called the SMPS (Switched
            Mode Power Supply). Its function is to convert AC (Alternating Current) to DC (Direct Current). All
            components within the computer system operate on DC power.</p>
        <h3>Motherboard and CPU</h3>
        <p>On the motherboard, the central component we'll focus on is the CPU (Central Processing Unit). The CPU
            performs all the processing, including arithmetic and logic operations, and controls the hardware. The
            instructions for our programs (like C programs) are stored in the memory, which is the RAM (Random Access
            Memory).</p>
        <h2>Memory and Storage</h2>
        <p>The RAM is volatile, meaning once you write your program, you need to save it. When saved, it is stored in
            the secondary storage, which can be a hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD).</p>
        <h2>The von Neumann Architecture</h2>
        <p>John von Neumann, a famous scientist, proposed the von Neumann architecture, which simplifies the study of
            computer systems. Most modern computer systems follow this architecture. The von Neumann architecture
            consists of four components:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Stores data and programs. It is volatile and requires secondary storage to
                    save
                    data.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Unit:</strong> Executes programs and manages the flow of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs arithmetic and logic operations requested
                    by
                    the program.</li>
                <li><strong>Input and Output (I/O):</strong> Devices that allow interaction with the computer system.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>All these components are connected by a bus, a communication subsystem that links the components of the
            system unit.</p>
        <h2>Memory Structure</h2>
        <p>Let's look more closely at the memory. There are two important aspects:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage Unit:</strong> This is where the actual bits and bytes are stored.</li>
                <li><strong>Address:</strong> This refers to the specific location in memory where data is stored.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The size of the memory determines how much data can be stored. For example, if <code>N = 4</code>, then you
            can have <code>2^4</code> storage units. Another important factor is the <strong>width of the
                memory</strong>, which refers to the number of bits that can be read at one time. A 32-bit CPU can read
            32 bits at a time, and a 64-bit CPU can read 64 bits at a time.</p>
        <h2>Memory Sizes</h2>
        <p>The typical memory sizes for personal computers and laptops are measured in gigabytes. Other memory sizes
            include kilobytes, megabytes, and terabytes.</p>
        <p>That's all we have for this lecture. In the next lecture, we'll dive deeper into computer architecture and
            programming concepts.</p>
    </div>


    <!-- Computer System Fundamentals: Part 2 -->
    <div class="container" id="Computer System Fundamentals Part 2">
        <h1>Week 1: Computer System Fundamentals - Part 2</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the second part of the computer system fundamentals. In the last video lecture, we discussed
            hardware and its various components. Today, we'll focus on the higher-level components: the operating system
            and application software.</p>
        <h2>Overview of Application Software</h2>
        <p>This is an overview of the application software in a computer system. As seen in the slide, there are
            multiple users, each performing different tasks. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User 1:</strong> Working on a compiler</li>
            <li><strong>User 2:</strong> Using an assembler</li>
            <li><strong>User 3:</strong> Editing text in a text editor</li>
            <li><strong>nth User:</strong> Managing a database system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these application software programs run on top of the operating system.</p>
        <h2>What is an Operating System?</h2>
        <p>An operating system (OS) acts as an interface between application software and hardware. It serves as a
            bridge between the two.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Formal Definition:</strong> An operating system is a layer between the application software and the
            hardware.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Goals of an Operating System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> It hides the hardware details. For example, when you save a program, the
                OS takes care of saving it to the hard disk, while hiding the underlying hardware processes from the
                user.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Use of Hardware:</strong> The OS allows multiple users to share the same hardware,
                making it seem as if each user has full control over the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> The OS ensures that users cannot see or access each other's work unless
                permitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is Application Software?</h2>
        <p>While the OS is called system software because it controls the hardware, application software is designed to
            perform specific tasks. Some examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compiler:</strong> Translates a C program into machine language.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Editor:</strong> Used for typing text.</li>
            <li><strong>Database System:</strong> Used for saving records.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Machine Code and High-Level Languages</h3>
        <p>The computer understands only binary code (zeros and ones), known as machine code. While machine code is very
            efficient for the computer to decode, it's difficult for humans to read and write. That's why we have
            high-level languages such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Fortran</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>High-level languages use English-like syntax, making them easier for humans to understand.</p>
        <h3>The Role of a Compiler</h3>
        <p>Since computers only understand machine code, we need a compiler to translate high-level language
            instructions into machine code.</p>
        <p>In the next video, we will learn how to write a C program.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Introduction to Algorithms -->
    <div class="container" id="Introduction to Algorithms">
        <h1>Week 1: Introduction to Algorithms</h1>

        <p>In this video, we will learn about an important concept: algorithms.</p>

        <h2>What is an Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>Flowchart is nothing but a graphical representation of an algorithm. They mean the same thing. In this video,
            I'll give you an introduction to algorithms and their definition. Later on in your program, you will have a
            full course on algorithms.</p>

        <p>A typical programming task involves two phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Problem-Solving Phase:</strong> In this phase, we produce an ordered sequence of steps that
                describes a solution to the problem. Emphasis on the word "ordered" means that steps must be followed in
                a specific sequence. For example, to make French fries, you first cut the potatoes and then put them in
                the frying pan. You cannot do it in reverse. This sequence of steps is called an algorithm.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Phase:</strong> In this phase, we translate the sequence of steps into a program
                using a programming language. In this course, we will use the C programming language to translate the
                sequence of steps into a program.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For very simple problems, you might not need to write a detailed algorithm and can start programming
            directly.</p>

        <h2>Example: Finding the Largest of Two Values</h2>
        <p>Let's understand algorithms with an example. The task is to read in two values and find out which one is
            larger. We want to print this with an identifying message, such as "The largest of the two is 7." Here is
            the algorithm for this task:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Read in two values: <em>value 1</em> and <em>value 2</em>.</li>
            <li>Compare the two values:
                <ul>
                    <li>If <em>value 1</em> is greater than <em>value 2</em>, assign <em>value 1</em> to <em>max</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>If <em>value 1</em> is not greater than <em>value 2</em>, assign <em>value 2</em> to
                        <em>max</em>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Print "The largest value is <em>max</em>."</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Characteristics of an Algorithm</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Takes Input:</strong> An algorithm takes input values.</li>
            <li><strong>Produces Output:</strong> An algorithm produces output values.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple and Unambiguous Steps:</strong> The steps are clear and straightforward. For example,
                comparing <em>value 1</em> with <em>value 2</em> and assigning the larger value to <em>max</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Finite Time:</strong> Each step of the algorithm takes a finite amount of time to complete. For
                example, assigning a value to <em>max</em> happens in a finite time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Converting Algorithms to Flowcharts</h2>
        <p>Now, let's convert the above algorithm into a flowchart. In a flowchart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input and Output:</strong> Represented by parallelograms. For instance, taking input values
                <em>value 1</em> and <em>value 2</em> is shown with a parallelogram.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Represented by diamond shapes. Comparing <em>value 1</em> with <em>value
                    2</em> is shown with a diamond shape.</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Represented by rectangles. Assigning <em>value 1</em> or <em>value 2</em>
                to <em>max</em> is shown with a rectangle.</li>
            <li><strong>Flow of Control:</strong> Shown by arrows connecting the shapes, indicating the sequence of
                steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the next video, we will learn how to convert this algorithm or flowchart into programming code. Thank you!

    <!-- Introduction to Linux Operating System -->
    <div class="container" id="Introduction to Linux Operating System">
        <h1>Week 1: Linux Primer I</h1>

        <p>In this video, we'll study the Linux operating system. The reason is that we'll be doing all our lab
            exercises in a Linux environment using the GNU C compiler. Linux is a widely used open-source operating
            system kernel that serves as the core component of various Unix-like operating systems. Linux was first
            launched on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Here's Linus Torvalds:</p>
        <img src="linus_torvalds.jpg" alt="Linus Torvalds" />

        <p>A Finnish-American software engineer, Linus Torvalds initiated Linux. One reason Linux is popular is that it
            is distributed under an open-source license, meaning its source code is freely available to the public.</p>

        <p>Here's Richard Stallman:</p>
        <img src="richard_stallman.jpg" alt="Richard Stallman" />

        <p>Richard Stallman is an American computer programmer and the founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). He
            is known for the development of the GNU Project, which provides essential software components for free. One
            of these is the GNU C compiler. Linux is a free operating system distributed under the open-source license.
            The GNU utilities include software components that are free, such as the C compiler.</p>

        <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
        <p>Linux is a Unix clone written from scratch by Linus Torvalds, with assistance from a loosely-knit team of
            developers across the net. By "loosely-knit," it means they were not paid but collaborated out of interest.
            It is a clone of Unix, meaning its operation is very similar to Unix.</p>

        <h2>What is Unix?</h2>
        <p>Unix is a multitasking operating system, meaning a user can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For
            example, you can compile code, write a C program, and listen to music at the same time. Unix is also
            multi-user, allowing multiple users to work on the same machine concurrently. While Windows is popular among
            desktop operating systems, Linux is prevalent among web servers due to its resistance to viruses.</p>

        <h2>Linux Distributions</h2>
        <p>When a user wants to obtain the Linux operating system, they typically download one of the Linux
            distributions. A Linux distribution includes the Linux kernel and additional software libraries and
            utilities from the GNU project, creating a complete operating system. Some popular distributions are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ubuntu:</strong> A user-friendly distribution known for its ease of use.</li>
            <li><strong>Debian:</strong> Known for its stability and large repository of software.</li>
            <li><strong>CentOS:</strong> A distribution designed for enterprise environments, based on Red Hat
                Enterprise Linux.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Connecting to a Linux System</h2>
        <p>To connect to a Linux system, you can:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Log in directly:</strong> Sit in front of a terminal and log in using a username and password,
                similar to Windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Connect remotely:</strong> You can use text mode through SSH (Secure Shell) or a graphical
                interface via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) from Windows, providing a Windows-like environment on Linux.
                Note that graphical interfaces may require more bandwidth compared to text mode.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Terminal</h2>
        <p>Once logged into a Linux system, you'll use a terminal for all your work, such as writing and compiling C
            programs. Here’s what a typical terminal looks like:</p>
        <img src="linux_terminal.jpg" alt="Linux Terminal" />

        <p>When you log in, you see your username, the name of the server, and the dollar prompt ($). This prompt
            indicates that the terminal is ready to accept commands. For example:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>user@maths9:~$ </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2>The Shell</h2>
        <p>The shell is a command interpreter that processes commands entered in the terminal. It communicates with the
            core of the operating system (the kernel). Popular shells include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>sh (Bourne Shell)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ksh (Korn Shell)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>bash (Bourne Again Shell)</strong>: The default shell in many Linux distributions. For this
                tutorial, we’ll use bash. Shell commands are case-sensitive, so <code>LS</code> and <code>ls</code> are
                different.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Help in Linux</h2>
        <p>If you need help with a command, you can use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>man:</strong> Stands for manual. For example, to learn about the <code>echo</code> command, type
                <code>man echo</code>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>info:</strong> Another way to get help, but <code>man</code> is more commonly used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Type <code>man [command]</code> to find out what a command does and its available options.</p>
    </div>



    <!-- Linux Commands and File System Hierarchy -->
    <div class="container" id="Linux Commands and File System Hierarchy">
        <h1>Week 1: Linux Primer II</h1>

        <p>In this video, we'll learn some of the most commonly used Linux commands.</p>

        <h2>Linux File System Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>The file structure of Linux, also known as the Linux file system hierarchy, is organized in a hierarchical
            manner, starting from the root and branching out into various subdirectories. So this is the root, and below
            this, you'll find the different subdirectories.</p>

        <p>One of the subdirectories that you'll find below root is <strong>boot</strong>. Boot means start. All the
            files related to starting the operating system are found in the boot directory.</p>

        <p><strong>user</strong> contains user-accessible programs, libraries, and data files. For example, the
            libraries of C will also be in this subdirectory.</p>

        <p><strong>bin</strong> stores all the executables. For instance, the C compiler that we'll be using is GCC, so
            all of those executables are in the bin directory. Bin stands for binary files.</p>

        <h2>Commonly Used Commands</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the kick-start commands that we'll be using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>passwd</code> - Change your password.</li>
            <li><code>logout</code> - Log out from the current session.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All of these commands are typed in the terminal, and the shell interprets these commands.</p>

        <p><strong>ls</strong> stands for list files and directories. Typing <code>ls</code> at the dollar prompt will
            show all the files in the current directory. To make a directory, type <code>mkdir</code>; to enter into a
            directory, use <code>cd</code>; to remove a directory, use <code>rmdir</code>; to display the contents of a
            file, use <code>cat</code> followed by the file name. I will log into the Linux system in a later video to
            show how these commands work.</p>

        <p>We will use the <code>ls</code> command frequently to view the files in the current directory. The
            <code>ls</code> command has many options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>ls -l</code> - Performs a long list, displaying a lot of information.</li>
            <li><code>ls -t</code> - Displays files in terms of their modification time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To remember all of these options, you can use the <code>man</code> command. For example, <code>man ls</code>
            will show you what the <code>ls</code> command does and the different flags that can be used with it. The
            <code>man</code> command provides the manual for various commands. As you become more familiar with Linux,
            you may not need to refer to <code>man ls</code> as often.
        </p>

        <p>The <code>ls -l</code> command displays detailed information about files, such as permissions, ownership, and
            file names. The <code>d</code> at the beginning indicates a directory, while files do not have this
            indicator.</p>

        <h2>Viewing File Contents</h2>
        <p>To view the contents of a file, use <code>cat</code>. There are other commands for viewing file contents in
            different ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>less</code> - Views file contents one screen at a time.</li>
            <li><code>head</code> - Displays the beginning of the file.</li>
            <li><code>tail</code> - Displays the end of the file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Finding and Archiving Files</h2>
        <p>To find where a particular file resides, use <code>which [file name]</code> for the part name of the file or
            <code>locate [file name]</code> to return the location of the file. To archive files, use <code>tar</code>
            or <code>gzip</code>.
        </p>

        <p><code>touch</code> updates the timestamp of a file to the current time. Pipelining is a technique where the
            output of one command is used as input for another. For example, <code>ls -l | wc -l</code> counts the
            number of lines from the <code>ls -l</code> output.</p>

        <h2>Additional Commands</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><code>pwd</code> - Displays the current working directory.</li>
            <li><code>rm</code> - Deletes a file.</li>
            <li><code>mv</code> - Moves or renames a file.</li>
            <li><code>cp</code> - Copies a file.</li>
            <li><code>ps</code> - Shows the list and information about running processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Piping and File Permissions</h2>
        <p>Piping is a form of redirection that transfers standard output as input to another process. For instance, the
            output of one command can be piped into another command.</p>

        <p>When working with files, we will use text editors to type C programs. Two common text editors are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>gedit</strong> - A graphical text editor that is easier for beginners.</li>
            <li><strong>vi</strong> - A text-mode editor with a steeper learning curve but is quicker once mastered.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>File Permissions</h2>
        <p>In a long list format, file permissions are displayed. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>r</code> - Read permission (value 4).</li>
            <li><code>w</code> - Write permission (value 2).</li>
            <li><code>x</code> - Execute permission (value 1).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>File Manipulation Command</h2>
        <p>-drwxr-xr-x 1 iyursmilx iyursmilx 512 Sep 4 12:28 iyursmilx</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FIRST(rwx)user----read(4),write(2),execute(1)</li>
            <li>SECOND(r-x)group---read(4),execute(1)</li>
            <li>THIRD(r-x)others---read(4),execute(1)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            <p>
                to cahnge the permission to file or a folder
                chmod ??? <name>-change file permisssion</p>
        </div>


        <p>For example, <code>chmod 755 hello.c</code> sets permissions where the owner has read, write, and execute
            permissions, and the group and others have read and execute permissions. You can change permissions using
            the <code>chmod</code> command, but be cautious as improper use may expose your files to unwanted access.
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, you can change the group and ownership of a file using <code>chgrp</code> and
            <code>chown</code>, respectively. To report on file system usage, you can use commands to check disk usage.
        </p>

        <p>In this video, we covered frequently used Linux commands. In the next video, I will demonstrate how these
            commands work by logging into the Linux system.</p>

    <!-- History and Evolution of C -->
    <div class="container" id="history-and-evolution-of-c">
        <h1>Week 1: History of C</h1>

        <p>C has been designed by Dennis Ritchie and evolved from two previous languages, BCPL and B.</p>

        <p><strong>BCPL</strong> stands for Basic Combined Programming Language, and B was its simplified successor.</p>

        <p>Since C evolved from B, it was named as C. Dennis Ritchie developed C to create the UNIX operating system,
            and for this contribution, he received the Turing Award, which is the highest honor in computer science.</p>

        <p>C was designed in the early 1970s, around 1972-73. By the late 1970s, it had evolved into what is called
            Traditional C, with multiple flavors available. In 1989, the American National Standard Institute (ANSI)
            standardized C, creating ANSI C, which was later updated in 1999.</p>

    <!-- First C Program: Hello World -->
    <div class="container" id="first-c-program">
        <h1>Week 1: First C Program: Hello World</h1>

        <p>Now, here is our first C program, commonly referred to as the <strong>Hello World</strong> program. This
            simple program outputs the words <strong>Hello World</strong> when compiled and executed.</p>

        <p>To write and execute this program, follow these steps:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Type the program in a text editor and save it as <code>hello.c</code>.</li>
            <li>Compile the program using a C compiler. If you are using Linux, the GNU C Compiler (gcc) can be used.
                The command to compile is:</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>gcc hello.c -o hello</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>This command creates an executable named <code>hello</code>.</p>

        <p>To run the program, use the following command:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>./hello</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The output will be:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>Hello World</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Compiler Options</h2>
        <p>There are multiple options available while compiling a C program. You can view these options by typing:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>gcc --help</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>This command displays all available compiler options for further customization.</p>
    </div>



    <!-- Detailed Explanation of the Hello World Program -->
    <div class="container" id="HelloWorldProgram">
        <h1>Week 1: Hello World Program in C</h1>

        <p>In this video, we typed out the "Hello World" program in a text editor, compiled it, and ran it. When we
            executed the program, it produced the output: <strong>Hello World</strong>. Let's now take a closer look at
            what the program does.</p>

        <h2>Preprocessing Directive</h2>
        <p>The first line of the program starts with a <code>#</code>. Lines that begin with this symbol are called
            <em>preprocessing directives</em>. These lines are processed by the preprocessor, which is not part of the
            compiler. The preprocessor's job is to include the contents of the file <code>stdio.h</code> in the program.
            This file contains information required for functions like <code>printf</code>, which we use to display
            text.
        </p>

        <p>The angle brackets around <code>stdio.h</code> (i.e., <code>&lt;&gt;</code>) indicate that the file is
            located in the standard header file directory. In Linux, for example, it is typically found in
            <code>/usr/include</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Function</h2>
        <p><code>main</code> is the name of a function. It is the first function that the compiler will execute. The
            <code>int</code> before <code>main</code> tells the compiler that this function will return an integer. The
            keyword <code>void</code> inside the parentheses means that the function takes no parameters.
        </p>

        <p>The braces (<code>{}</code>) denote the beginning and end of the function, which is referred to as the
            function body. These braces are also called <em>punctuators</em> in C.</p>

        <h2>Printf Function</h2>
        <p>The <code>printf</code> function is responsible for printing text to the console. The string
            <code>"Hello World"</code> is passed as an argument to <code>printf</code>, which then displays it. The
            escape sequence <code>\n</code> represents a newline character, so after printing "Hello World," the cursor
            moves to the next line.
        </p>

        <h2>Return Statement</h2>
        <p>Finally, we have <code>return 0;</code>. This statement tells the program to return the value 0 to the
            operating system, indicating that the program has executed successfully. The reason we use
            <code>return 0</code> is that we declared the <code>main</code> function to return an integer
            (<code>int</code>), and this is fulfilling that requirement.
        </p>

        <h2>Semicolons in C</h2>
        <p>All C statements, such as <code>printf</code> and <code>return</code>, must end with a semicolon
            (<code>;</code>). This is a fundamental syntax rule in C.</p>

        <p>In the upcoming videos, we'll dive deeper into the syntax and structure of C programs.</p>

    <!-- C Program to Find the Largest of Two Values -->
    <div class="container" id="largest-of-two-values">
        <h1>Week 1: Converting Algorithm to C Code: Largest of Two Values</h1>

        <p>In this section, we will complete the task of converting an algorithm to a C program. This process involves
            two main phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Problem-solving phase:</strong> Writing an algorithm that describes a solution to the problem.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Translation phase:</strong> Translating the algorithm into a C code.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We'll convert the following algorithm, which finds the largest of two values, into a C program:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>
Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Read value1, value2
3. If value1 > value2, then
   max = value1
   else max = value2
4. Print max
5. Stop
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Step-by-Step C Code</h2>

        <p>Let’s walk through the conversion of the algorithm into a C code.</p>

        <h3>Including Libraries</h3>
        <p>The first step is to include the necessary libraries for input and output. For the <code>printf</code> and
            <code>scanf</code> functions, we use the <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> directive:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Writing the Main Function</h3>
        <p>Next, we define the main function, which is the entry point of a C program. It returns an integer type (int)
            and does not take any parameters, so we use <code>void</code>:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>int main(void) {
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
        <p>We need to declare the variables that will store the two input values and the maximum value. We declare them
            as integers:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>int val1, val2, max;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Reading Input</h3>
        <p>To read the input values, we use the <code>scanf</code> function. Since we are reading integers, we use the
            format specifier <code>%d</code> along with the addresses of the variables (using <code>&amp;</code>):</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>scanf("%d %d", &amp;val1, &amp;val2);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Comparing Values</h3>
        <p>Next, we compare the two values using an if-else statement. If <code>val1</code> is greater than
            <code>val2</code>,
            we assign <code>val1</code> to <code>max</code>. Otherwise, we assign <code>val2</code> to <code>max</code>:
        </p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>if (val1 > val2) {
        max = val1;
    } else {
        max = val2;
    }</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Printing the Result</h3>
        <p>Finally, we print the maximum value using the <code>printf</code> function:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>printf("The largest value is: %d", max);</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Ending the Program</h3>
        <p>We close the main function with a return statement to indicate successful execution:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>return 0;
}</code></pre>
        </div>
        <h2>Complete C Program</h2>
        <p>Here is the full C program to find the largest of two values:</p>
        <div class="math">

            <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    int val1, val2, max;
    scanf("%d %d", &amp;val1, &amp;val2);

    if (val1 > val2) {
        max = val1;
    } else {
        max = val2;
    }

    printf("The largest value is: %d", max);
    return 0;
}
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>You can now run this program in your lab and check the output by providing different input values.</p>
    </div>


    <!-- Introduction to Input and Output Statements in C -->
    <div class="container" id="input_output_in_c">
        <h1>Week 1: Input and Output in C</h1>

        <p>In this section, we'll explore input and output statements in C, which allow users to interact with a
            program.
            Two of the most commonly used statements are <code>scanf</code> for input and <code>printf</code> for
            output.
            You've already seen <code>printf</code> in action in the "Hello World" program. Let's now dive deeper into
            these functions.</p>

        <h2>Using <code>scanf</code> for Input</h2>
        <p>The <code>scanf</code> function is used to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard). The
            function
            is declared in the <code>stdio.h</code> library, so we need to include this file when using input and output
            statements
            in our program.</p>

        <p><code>scanf</code> works by reading formatted input, which requires <strong>format specifiers</strong> to
            indicate
            the data type being read. For example, <code>%d</code> is used to read an integer. Here is how it works:</p>

        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>
    int radius;
    scanf("%d", &radius);  // Read an integer and store it in 'radius'
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>In this case, <code>%d</code> is the format specifier for an integer, and <code>&radius</code> refers to the
            address
            of the variable where the input will be stored. Other format specifiers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>%c</code>: For reading a character</li>
            <li><code>%f</code>: For reading a floating-point number</li>
            <li><code>%s</code>: For reading a string</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using <code>printf</code> for Output</h2>
        <p>The <code>printf</code> function outputs data to the standard output (usually the monitor). Like
            <code>scanf</code>,
            <code>printf</code> uses format specifiers to format the output. For example, to print an integer, use
            <code>%d</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>
    printf("The value of radius is %d", radius);  // Output the value of 'radius'
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>In this case, <code>%d</code> will be replaced by the value stored in <code>radius</code>. Here are some
            other format
            specifiers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>%c</code>: For printing a character</li>
            <li><code>%f</code>: For printing a floating-point number</li>
            <li><code>%s</code>: For printing a string</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Program: Adding Two Integers</h2>
        <p>Let's write a program that uses <code>scanf</code> to input two integers and <code>printf</code> to output
            their sum:</p>
        <div class="math">
            <pre><code>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main() {
        int num1, num2, sum;

        // Input two integers
        printf("Enter two integers: ");
        scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);

        // Compute the sum
        sum = num1 + num2;

        // Output the result
        printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, sum);

        return 0;
    }
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>In this program, <code>scanf</code> reads two integers and stores them in <code>num1</code> and
            <code>num2</code>.
            The sum is then computed and stored in <code>sum</code>. Finally, <code>printf</code> outputs the result
            using format
            specifiers <code>%d</code> to print the values of <code>num1</code>, <code>num2</code>, and
            <code>sum</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this section, we've learned how to use the <code>scanf</code> and <code>printf</code> functions for
            formatted input
            and output in C. These two functions are essential for reading user input and displaying output, and you'll
            continue to
            use them as you explore more C programs.</p>
