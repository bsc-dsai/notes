        About Data 
            def- collection of info facts values
            the data is used as basis for computation analysis and desicion making
            numbers, text, image element, audio or video
            data is raw material that is processed organised interpreted to extract meaning and generate insights
            data is a fundamental concept imporatnt for in various feilds science buisness and reaserch
            data is considered as a key in this digital age
        
            ex- facebook post text describing about a post having images and is about a particular event 
                type of data - text no of likes image  names no of comments by users etc
            ex- data published in a news article 
                type of data - text (author, facts, day, where it is published), associarted image elemets
            ex- youtube
                type - videos, (tumbnails, text associalte with video, lenthof video, creator, video related to a particular topic etc)
            ex- live processed data (train app, stock market data)
                type - live data periodically updated
        
        
        **Data 01
            Numbers- ex- qunatity=10, price=200
            qualitative data- {"Un-married","married", "Divorced"}, {"Students", "Faculty"}  has discrete values [Has No Relation between elemets]
            qunatitaive data- {1=poor, 2= fair, 3=good, 4=verry good, 5= excellent} has discrete values but are associarted with something
            bolean valuse {true, false}
            temproral data- date, time, time stamp
            textual data- sequences of characters like words, sentences 
            mixed data- combination of all above data
            audio data- songs
            image data- screenshort, image captured using camera
            video data- combination of different img and audio data
        
        data can be stored   in spreadsheets, notepad, as an post as article etc
        
        
        Real valued data
            Analysis ex01
                to byu a book The linux programming interface by michale kerrisk from web
                to byu the book from store which offeres best price 
                now collect data from ecomerce website
                        1. amazon=5594.07
                        2. flipkart=5599
                        3. books.redif=5378
                        4. bookswagon=7738
                        5. sanpdeal=not available
        
        qualitative data
            Analysis ex03
                youtub-video-- how many viewers disliked or liked the video-----more likes of video has strong correlationn to increase in revenue
        
        text data
            analysis ex04
                amazon--product--book--product review--this info is available in form of text---this data help to know the performance of product like if they have liked it or not
        
        
        
        
        **issues in collecting data
        
            bias and sampling issues
        
                sampling bias--- when sample collected does not  represent the entire population 
                    ex- in the collection of price of book above we have visited only few webpages not the whole internet
                selection bais--- when the participants are not selected randomly leading to inaccrate results 
                    ex- like me when i was searching for the price one website just appeared in mind even before searching the web amazon
                nonresponse bais--- when a signifiacnt portion of the selected participants does not respond, 
                    ex- like in the above example i was searching a technical book about programming thus if i vist a stoty book site it will not provide the book i want, thus it prmotes a non response bias as, the site is about books among the population of sites but the book i want is not availabe in that category of book stores
        
            measurment issues
        
                measurment error--- inaccuracies or inconsistent in measurement instruments leading to incorrect or imprecise data
        
                subjective measurements---when data is collected through subjective method like surveys, for ex an indiviual can respond based on the personal thoughts etc
        
                social desirability bias---participants will provide responses they belive are socially acceptable than their own opinions
        
            data quality and integrity issues
        
                data integrity issues
                missing values
                a data record that is not complete 
                data entry error
                duplication in data
        
            ethical and privacy concerns
                informed consent
                privacy protection---protecting participants identity
                anonymity
        
            technological challenges
                data security
                data storage

            resource limitaion
                financial limitaion--- funding for tools etc
                time constraints--- rushed data may result into error and incomplete data
        
        
        **Types analytics
        analytics componets
            1.buisness context why we want to analyse data
                ex-- to pridict if coustomer is willing to buy a particular product based on their interest 
                
                ex-- in a particular service if a coustomer leave the service we can pridict way before of 
                    time to ask the coustomer to address the core concern to retain such more customers
         
        
        1. descriptive analytics
            -focus on summarizing and interpreting the historical data 
            -it give a insight into past trends
            -provide a clear and concise representation of data in order to understand the data and help in
             good decision making
             
             main theme is to summarize the large data into managable and interpretable forms, and identify the patterns and trends present in historical data 
        
        
        2. predictive analytics
            -focus is on finding the future trend given historical data and current data
            -the goal is to build a model that can learn historical data, use it to make prediction about      
             future data
        
             ex- customer churn---customer is leaving the service

            Fixed Row, Varying Column and Effect of Copy
        
            ● Cell is referred as (Column Name, Row Number).
            
            ● In order for copy not to change row number, place DOLLAR sign in front of row.
            
            ● Example: Cell B1 contains the formula A$10
            
            ● When formula in cell B1 is copied to cell C1,
                ○ As there is NO DOLLAR sign in column name, it is varied to B.
                ○ As there is DOLLAR sign in row 10, the row number 10 remains constant.
                ○ There the formula produced in cell C1 is: B10
        
            Fixed Row, Varying Column and Effect of Copy

            ● In order for copy not to change column name, place DOLLAR sign in front column name.
            
            ● Example: Cell B1 contains the formula $A10
            
            ● When formula in cell B1 is copied to cell B2,
                ○ As there is DOLLAR sign in column name, column name is NOT varied. It is A
                ○ As there is NO DOLLAR sign in row 10, the row number changes to11.
                ○ There the formula produced in cell B1 is: A11

        ####Example Predicting The Number of Customers
            Predicting The Number of Customers At 10th Year
        
            ● Given inputs
                ○ Number of customers at the beginning of year 1 = 100
                ○ Number of customers acquired over the year = 20
                ○ Percentage of customers who leave the services = 15%
            
            ● Problem is to compute the number of customers at the end of year 10.
            
            ● Solution approach is to compute the following four quantities
                ○ Number of customers at the beginning of each year
                ○ New customers joined in that year
                ○ Estimated number of customers who quit the services
                ○ Customers at the end of that year
        
        
        ####Coffee Demand Curve Estimation
        
            
            ● Given inputs
                ○ Coffee Demand (in number of cups) = (100 – 15 * price)
                ○ Profit = (Price of cup – Original unit cost) * Coffee Demand
            
            ● Estimate the profit when
            
            ● The original unit cost varies from $0.5 to $2.0 and
                ○ Price of one coffee cup is sold is varied from $2.0 to $5.0.
            
            ● Solution approach is to compute the following four quantities
                ○ Number of customers at the beginning of each year
                ○ New customers joined in that year
                ○ Estimated number of customers who quit the services
                ○ Customers at the end of that year

        ####Referring Cells Using VLOOKUP
            
            ● Individual Cells are referred using (column name, row number) format
            
            ● One must know the column name AND row number to access a cell.
            
            ● Many a times we know a value and we want to access cells based on the known value.
        
        
            Roll numbers are stored in column A
            
            ● Names are stored in column B
            
            ● CPI information is stored in column C
            
            ● Given a roll number (say 124), access corresponding CPI of the student.
            
            ● CPI is not accessed using C3 however with the known value of roll number.
            
            ● Cell value to be accessed is present in C3.

            In each of these examples, given a value, retrieve information that we are seeking.
                
                ● VLOOKUP help achieve this task
                
                ● VLOOKUP is a function.
                
                ● It takes FOUR arguments
                
                ● Returns the value that is being associated with the search value.
                    ○ Value that is being searched
                        ■ Example: 124 (roll number)
                    ○ The range of cells in which the value is being searched
                        ■ A2:C4 (3 cells in column A, Column B and Column C). One of the columns must correspond to roll numbers
                    ○ Column index from which the search value is being obtained. In this example, column index is 3
                    ○ Range look up: TRUE or FALSE.
        
        
            ● Lookup Value that is being searched – example roll number 124
            
            ● The range of cells in which the value is being searched
                ○ A2:C4 (4 cells in columns A, B and C). One of the columns must correspond to roll numbers
            
            ● Column index from which the search value is being obtained
            
            ● Optional: TRUE OR FALSE
                ○ For an exact match – FALSE
                ○ For an approximate match - TRUE.

            ● We look at examples involving approximate match.
        
            ● When the value being searched is not present in the first column of the table, then Excel bases the lookup on the largest value in the first column that is less than the lookup value
        
            ● VLOOKUP searches for values in the righthand direction
        
            ● Lefthanded search cannot be performed using VLOOKUP alone
        
            ● When duplicate values are present, VLOOKUP will find the first match
        
            ● If First column is unsorted then perform exact search(False)
                VLOOKUP(,,,False)
        
        #### Referring Cells Using HLOOKUP
            HLOOKUP look up for values in rows.
            It takes FOUR arguments
            Returns the value that is being associated with the search value.
        
            row index
        
            =HLOOKUP(B8, $B$2:$D$3, 2, TRUE)
        
        #### Referring Cells Using XLOOKUP
            XLOOKUP work with both column data (as in VLOOKUP), row data (as in HLOOKUP)
        
            Can lookup both righthand direction and lefthand direction
        
            Can return more than one value
        
            Can perform reverse search
        
          XLOOKUP arguments
            ● Lookup value – a cell OR a group of cells
            ● Lookup array – the range of cells within which search should be performed
            ● Return array – Column/row from where values to be returned
            ● Not found – Value to return if no match is found
            ● Match mode - {Exact, Exact or Next smallest, Exact or Next Largest, …}
            ● Search mode – search from {first, last, …}  
        
            =XLOOKUP(Lookup Value, Lookup array, Return array, Not found Message, Match mode, Search mode)
            
            =XLOOKUP(J2, J2:J6, O2:O6, 0, 1)
                        
            Match mode	0	Exact match
            Match mode	-1	Exact match or next smaller
            Match mode	1	Exact match or next larger
        
        
        #### Referring Cells Using INDEX
        
            ● Group of cells are referred using colon notation
            ● A1:C3 refers to cells A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2 and C3
            ● Index function allows to us to think group of cells A1:C3 as if they are a two-dimensional array (or a matrix).
            ● Access the elements using row number and column number notation
                  A(1) B(2)  C(3)
                1  A1   B1    C1
                2  A2   B2    C2
                3  A3   B3    C3
                    B2 is accessed as: INDEX(A1:C3, 2, 2)
                    C2 is accessed as: INDEX(A1:C3, 2, 3)
        
        
        #### MATCH Function
        
        
            ● Column A has list of roll numbers.
            ● Given a specific roll number 1234, find in which row this value is appearing in column A?
            ● In this example, this roll number is appearing in second row.
            ● This example shows an exact match of MATCH
                            
                            (A)Roll Number
                        1   1233
                        2   1234
                        3   1235
                        4   1236
        
            0 exact match
            1 approximate match
        
            =MATCH(A2, A2:C6, 0)
